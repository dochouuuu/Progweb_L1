# Full-Stack Image Gallery Application

This project involves the **development of a full-stack web application for displaying image galleries**, built **from scratch (without any frameworks)** during my **first year** as part of a Web Programming course.

This branch corresponds to the **initial draft / baseline version** of the project. It contains the **very first files created from scratch**, with early functionality implemented and some features currently in a **draft or partial implementation stage**. 

This branch serves as a **reference snapshot** of the project’s early state and allows recovery if later development introduces breaking changes.
