# Full-Stack Image Gallery Application

This project involves the **development of a full-stack web application for displaying image galleries**, built **from scratch (without any frameworks)** during my **first year** as part of a Web Programming course.

The application allows users to browse image galleries, authenticate, and interact through a commenting system. Some features are currently in a **draft or partial implementation stage**.
